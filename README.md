# Tasks
Four tasks completed for the module Fundamentals of data analytics.

The tasks are well annotated withing the notebook, so I will refrain from repeating that information too much here.

# Task 1
The first task successful in generating a dictionary with accompanying valiues for each unique element's number of appearances in a given list. The final function was dynamic enough to deal with any list given to it, and withstood a series of tests run with a variety of input types.

# Task 2
The second task succeeded in taking two variable: k = Number of Dice, and n = Number of Rolls and was able to generate an aarray of outcomes. I then used the funcion from the first task to display the array in a dictionary of elements. The variables can be changed to simulate different scenarios regarding different numbers of dice and rolls.

# Task 3
In the third task I used the binomial function from numpy.random to calculate and display the probability distribution of possible outcomes in the case of flipping a coin 100 times, using a histogram to prove that it follows a bell shaped curve.

# Task 4
In the fourth task I created 4 data sets, each with an array of x and corresponding y values and used these to demonstrate Simpson's Pradox using linear regression displayed on a scatterplot with best-fit lines. I then briefly discussed the implcations of this effect based on real life examples.
